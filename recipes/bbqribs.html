    <p>
      This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've tried, but for
      super tender ribs, give it a try! Lean, country-style pork ribs are boiled
      in seasoned water until tender, then finished up in the oven under a
      blanket of your favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection. That's
      it! Back to simplicity, back to country life
    </p>

    <ul>
      <strong>Ingredients</strong>
      <li>2 1/2 pounds country-style pork ribs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup barbeque sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <strong>Directions</strong>
      <li>
        Place ribs in a large pot and cover with water. Stir in kosher salt,
        garlic powder, and pepper, and bring water to a boil over medium heat.
        Continue to boil until ribs are tender, 40 to 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the ribs are boiling, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove ribs from the pot, and place them in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
        Pour barbeque sauce over ribs. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the pork
        has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
